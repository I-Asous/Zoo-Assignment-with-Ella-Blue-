        The species is named for its clog-shaped bill, which is an adaptation for catching and holding the large, slippery lungfish, its favourite food. This big bird also eats turtles, fish, and young crocodiles. Shoebills stand about 115 cm (3.8 feet) tall. 
        They are entirely gray, with broad wings and long legs. The head is large in proportion to the body, and the eyes are also exceptionally large.
