      The stocky, short-legged appearance of penguins has endeared them to people worldwide. 
      They range from about 35 cm (14 inches) in height and approximately 1 kg (about 2 pounds) in weight in the blue, or fairy, penguin (Eudyptula minor) to 115 cm (45 inches) and 25 to 40 kg (55 to 90 pounds) in the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). 
      Most are black on the back and white below, often with lines of black across the upper breast or spots of white on the head.
